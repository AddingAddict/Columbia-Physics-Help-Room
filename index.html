<h1>Welcome to the Columbia Physics Help Room!</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:35px;"><mark>Please note that Thursday April 15th is the final day that help room will be run.</mark></h1>
<p>This semester, we're splitting up the help room into two broad sections: first semester courses (primarily classical mechanics) and second year courses (primarily electromagnetism). You may also ask conceptual questions related to the lab courses, but you are not allowed to ask about grades or lab reports, and non-lab students get priority.</p>
<p>Please select the help room section for the class you need help with.</p>

<!-- <h1>Help Room Sections</h1>
<p><a href="CM/index.html">1201/1401/1601 (Primarily Classical Mechanics)</a></p>
<p><a href="EM/index.html">1202/1402/1602 (Primarily Electromagnetism)</a></p> -->
