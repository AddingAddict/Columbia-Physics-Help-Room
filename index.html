<h1 style="font-size:35px;"><mark>Please note that due to the graduate student strike, some help room time slots will not be staffed. We apologize for any inconvenience that may cause you, and hope that you are able to find a staffed help room time slot at a different hour.</mark></h1>
<h1>Welcome to the Columbia Physics Help Room!</h1>
<p>This semester, we're splitting up the help room into two broad sections: first semester courses (primarily classical mechanics) and second year courses (primarily electromagnetism). You may also ask conceptual questions related to the lab courses, but you are not allowed to ask about grades or lab reports, and non-lab students get priority.</p>
<p>Please select the help room section for the class you need help with.</p>

<h1>Help Room Sections</h1>
